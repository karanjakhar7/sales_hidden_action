      "Message: Hi [Client's Name], hope all is well. This is a friendly reminder regarding a few upcoming tasks. Firstly, ensuring the NDA is in place following the legal team's review, which is slated for completion in about a month. Additionally, we need to assess the POC success criteria right after the POC kickoff, scheduled for next week. Lastly, please keep in mind the planning for the replacement of Terraform Cloud, with stakeholder buy-in and approval expected by the end of December. Looking forward to your updates and next steps.\n",
