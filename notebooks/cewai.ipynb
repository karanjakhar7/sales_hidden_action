      "  I can make some intros. And the team, we were going to demo it. And Taylor is one to fully embrace that.  Technology early she's already jumped in on a 14 day free trial on this plan. Okay amazing call so but so I head up our strategy here Sean and I co-founded five tool about five years ago and He has a part tech All things technology for us And then Taylor is our content manager slash strategist on that side.  So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.  I've tried almost everything It's a nightmare he said drop is crushing it. It's not cheap, but They have kind of cracked the code on this thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Awesome. Glad to hear that Skyler is happy. And like, yeah, more than happy to show you letter drop and answer any questions for you as well.  So perhaps, and I appreciate you sending me that email with your entire tech stack. If there is one thing I can do for you on this call, what would that be?  I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.  And I'm sure Taylor, as much as you've tried it, there are parts of it that you probably haven't discovered yet.  And so my goal is to make sure you have information you need to make the right decisions for your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "2:45 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor, I'm gonna give you one, and I think Taylor should probably give you one as well from my. I think we're doing some of this stuff that isn't a must have that letter drops doing.  Like you're doing some kind of clear scope type things in there. Okay. From a reporting standpoint, I think that's cool.  We're doing some of that.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  I think I cheated by adding some there. That's, that's okay. My takeaway with like the project management approvals, content workflow was, was the piece that matters to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:18 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Got you. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:20 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",

      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, it's like the cheapest worst on Fiverr is kind of like what I see. It's like, okay, yeah, we're asking them to write you an ebook, like you've gone to the wrong place.\n",

      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

      "41:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

What's your, what's just tell me your email address that you sign up with. I'll go find the workspace and I'll kind of just like make sure that that doesn't expire for you.\n",

If there's any questions, any bugs, Taylor, like that bugs with the collapsed deadlines, expanded lines, we're very responsive. And we can be because you get to talk directly to CEO, become like, I care very deeply about our customers.  It's not like a sauna. We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Oh good Well, we did a ton of content for them Amazing I learned sales from you guys actually They're they're really good Ryan Robinson works for him He actually has his own blog as like over a half million views on Ryan is the person Ryan is the person I reached out to I think Yeah, I'll talk with Ryan and let him know they've got they've got a machine over there I certainly would love if they're using it As we continue to work with them But they'd be a good Whether it's using it through us or they're just using themselves like we like Ryan and their team a lot so no matter what Yeah, it's incredibly valuable for them Absolutely and yeah, hopefully this works out for you and in two weeks We get to work together, but I also want to let you know in the same way that and I offer this to Skyler as well is While we are not\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

Okay amazing call so but so I head up our strategy here Sean and I co-founded five tool about five years ago and He has a part tech All things technology for us And then Taylor is our content manager slash strategist on that side.  So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.  I've tried almost everything It's a nightmare he said drop is crushing it. It's not cheap, but They have kind of cracked the code on this thing.\n",

So perhaps, and I appreciate you sending me that email with your entire tech stack. If there is one thing I can do for you on this call, what would that be?  I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.  And I'm sure Taylor, as much as you've tried it, there are parts of it that you probably haven't discovered yet.  And so my goal is to make sure you have information you need to make the right decisions for your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "2:45 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor, I'm gonna give you one, and I think Taylor should probably give you one as well from my. I think we're doing some of this stuff that isn't a must have that letter drops doing.  Like you're doing some kind of clear scope type things in there. Okay. From a reporting standpoint, I think that's cool.  We're doing some of that.\n",

      "\n",
      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  I think I cheated by adding some there. That's, that's okay. My takeaway with like the project management approvals, content workflow was, was the piece that matters to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:18 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Got you. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:20 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",

      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end.

I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

Okay amazing call so but so I head up our strategy here Sean and I co-founded five tool about five years ago and He has a part tech All things technology for us And then Taylor is our content manager slash strategist on that side.  So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.

I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.  And I'm sure Taylor, as much as you've tried it, there are parts of it that you probably haven't discovered yet.

      "\n",
      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  I think I cheated by adding some there. That's, that's okay. My takeaway with like the project management approvals, content workflow was, was the piece that matters to you.\n",

      "4:20 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

And we can be because you get to talk directly to CEO, become like, I care very deeply about our customers.  It's not like a sauna. We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

Okay amazing call so but so I head up our strategy here Sean and I co-founded five tool about five years ago and He has a part tech All things technology for us And then Taylor is our content manager slash strategist on that side.  So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.

So perhaps, and I appreciate you sending me that email with your entire tech stack. If there is one thing I can do for you on this call, what would that be?  I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.  And I'm sure Taylor, as much as you've tried it, there are parts of it that you probably haven't discovered yet.

      "\n",
      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  I think I cheated by adding some there. That's, that's okay. My takeaway with like the project management approvals, content workflow was, was the piece that matters to you.\n",

      "\n",
      "4:20 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

Okay amazing call so but so I head up our strategy here Sean and I co-founded five tool about five years ago and He has a part tech All things technology for us And then Taylor is our content manager slash strategist on that side.  So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.  I've tried almost everything It's a nightmare he said drop is crushing it. It's not cheap, but They have kind of cracked the code on this thing.\n",

So perhaps, and I appreciate you sending me that email with your entire tech stack. If there is one thing I can do for you on this call, what would that be?  I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.  And I'm sure Taylor, as much as you've tried it, there are parts of it that you probably haven't discovered yet.

      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  I think I cheated by adding some there. That's, that's okay. My takeaway with like the project management approvals, content workflow was, was the piece that matters to you.\n",

      "4:20 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",

      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.

I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.

      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",

      "4:20 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",

      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.

I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.

      "3:07 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think the biggest is where we struggle is we use contractors quite a bit. And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",

      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",

      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",

      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end.

We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.

I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.

And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",

      "  Taylor. Specifically, yeah. No, Mark, you took at least four of my biggest pain points and rolled them all in there.  But specifically, it's managing at that high level, knowing where everything is at at any given time and having that oversight.  Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",

      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",

      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",

      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",

      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end.

We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.

So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.

I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.

And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",

      "4:08 - Homer (Acme)\n",

And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",

And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay.

Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.

I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",

      "35:24 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "\n",
      "38:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

And we can be because you get to talk directly to CEO, become like, I care very deeply about our customers.  It's not like a sauna. We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

And so learning more about your needs, kind of like the writer analytics and like work, like putting like the number of hours in there.  Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.  And like I forget like you're not gonna solve all of our problems, but if you know, enough people have it then it's gonna get sold.\n",

And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",

And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",

      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",

A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",

      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, it's like the cheapest worst on Fiverr is kind of like what I see. It's like, okay, yeah, we're asking them to write you an ebook, like you've gone to the wrong place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:21 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:24 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "38:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.  And like I forget like you're not gonna solve all of our problems, but if you know, enough people have it then it's gonna get sold.\n",

So she's helping move things through pipeline She was very eager to jump into this because We've been piece-mealing things together.  We use a sauna and kind of how we heard about you was Skylar Reeves he's using product I believe and right now We've I've been Skylar for a couple years now and he's like look I've tried a sauna.

I wanna make sure I'm getting that information out to you because letter drop does cover a lot of stuff.

And the ability to have an ecosystem, like helping us understand how the content flows through from like the keyword research through to assigning it out to writers and people are producing the content brief for Convlythepress, but those.  And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",

And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",

And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",

      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, it's like the cheapest worst on Fiverr is kind of like what I see. It's like, okay, yeah, we're asking them to write you an ebook, like you've gone to the wrong place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:21 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:24 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "38:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

If there's any questions, any bugs, Taylor, like that bugs with the collapsed deadlines, expanded lines, we're very responsive. And we can be because you get to talk directly to CEO, become like, I care very deeply about our customers.  It's not like a sauna. We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.  And like I forget like you're not gonna solve all of our problems, but if you know, enough people have it then it's gonna get sold.\n",

And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",

Even if I have one contract or working on multiple clients, being able to see everything that they're working on, just making sure workloads are even and distributed and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",

      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, it's like the cheapest worst on Fiverr is kind of like what I see. It's like, okay, yeah, we're asking them to write you an ebook, like you've gone to the wrong place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:21 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:24 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "\n",
      "38:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",

So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",

And we can be because you get to talk directly to CEO, become like, I care very deeply about our customers.  It's not like a sauna. We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

And so learning more about your needs, kind of like the writer analytics and like work, like putting like the number of hours in there.  Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.  And like I forget like you're not gonna solve all of our problems, but if you know, enough people have it then it's gonna get sold.\n",

And then actually the content writers, like we've got a lot of moving pieces in here. So like how does that workflow look?  And I think along that is like we're an agency. So we have multiple clients. So like helping us understand like how do you manage multiple clients, particularly when you need to see the holistic view outside of just like the content process.  Like so is it like one instance for each. each client and then that all rolls up into a single view.  Like just don't really understand that piece on the Taylor. That was another one thing.\n",

      "4:49 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Cool. Sounds good. And then I know there are lots of parts of letter drop, which I imagine possibly fall outside of the services you're off.  offering to your customers, things like, or I don't know, I'm just curious, like social distribution or like leveraging their sales team to get content distributed.  Um, any of that like is, is within your purview or things you want to, like think of like being valued out of your customers right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:19 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think social is one that we haven't historically done, but are like, like what we've done it, but very sporadically, we haven't made it like a priority, but it's becoming more of one.  And so I think touching on that would be, would be pretty valuable as well. Like, how are you attaching social, like you've produced a piece of content where like we see social posts attached to that, things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "5:45 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And, um, the last question I had was in terms of, uh, actual production of content, um, are you using, um, any tooling around that and the AI  Is this a writing or do you have like anything that's helping you speed that along? Or do you have any problems around content creation and solve?\n",
      "\n",
      "6:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  We are dabbling. We had a little competition last week where Taylor had a human and AI write articles. And then we tried to guess who was who with a little bit of like editing afterwards.  Yeah. So we're we're starting to go that route and then we're leveraging. I pretty more and more for brief creation content ideation.  A lot of different areas we're using it a bit like a like a VA to a certain degree to do a lot of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's the right way to be thinking about it as an assistant and not a replacement as well.  And what I can do is I can show you some stuff that's on our roadmap. I think we're thinking about content creation.  and using AI pretty neatly there. And so I'm happy to show you a little bit of that as well.  I think the one thing I will say before we jump into this conversation is that letter drop right now is we primarily just sell directly to companies.  Skyler is one among a handful of agencies who have started adopting letter drop. And so we're still figuring out what that relationship looks like.  We don't really know what pricing looks like or any of that stuff for agencies right now. We actually tried selling to agencies about a year ago younger.  And I think the big thing we saw from agencies and the reasons why we haven't focused on them is people are like, look, we have like whatever 20, 30, 40 clients.  And I know our process today doesn't work great. But it is a massive change management and like operation for us to even.  Think about this. And so from our perspective, I was like, okay, that's completely reasonable and fine. And so we were like, we need to build our customer base directly with companies first and become more established before we start talking to agencies.  So that's where we are as a business in terms of who we sell to. So I just wanted to throw that caveat out there where everything you were seeing for the most part is built for essentially a concrete marketing manager at a company to manage things themselves.  And we're really thinking about, okay, like, how do we automate some of their work and how do we get content to drive revenue for that business, which is why it integrates with the sales team integrates with like all these other aspects of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:41 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. And I'd say in that vein, I mean, we're similar to Skylearn that like we pursue large engagements and larger contract value.  Like we're trying to get our goal list, we're around by 10K on average per month with clients. And we're trying to get closer like that.  that 15 to 20K. We much prefer like Series C above type companies have established marketing teams that we can do massive content scaling.  And so that's why we're kind of interested in this. It's not a huge change management thing for us at this point simply because it's in a sauna right now and it's just, it's templated out, but like that shift isn't that difficult for us because we're not moving 40, 50 clients over.  Like this is one where we could, because the size of our engagements, we could consider like separate instances for each client.  But ultimately, I think where the pain point there would be is like we need a holistic view. So if like you're just not awaiting it yet there, that becomes a little bit of a sticking point, but I'm still.\n",
      "\n",
      "9:54 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, we actually, yeah, we do have a holistic view. Like I said, it wasn't, it was built. So we have an.  agency side to our business as well. It's largely not like an agency in the sense. It's more of like an unblocker where we early on, we would talk to like small companies, they'd be like, tool looks great.  We don't have anyone to use it. It'll be like, what happens when we use it for you? And that's how our agency operation came about and it exists primarily to dog, but our product at this point.  And so we have some internal tooling around that, which is going to be useful to you. And I'm going to show you that.  Um, but, um, I would be lying if I said, like, we've fully flushed that out and like, it's like super production ready.  Um, cool. So with that, I'm going to jump in and, um, um, sort of a share my screen, walk through, um, mostly like the content workflow type stuff.\n",
      "  SCREEN SHARING: Parthi started screen sharing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/KLuL35y3F-iuJm-kxtJprj6ur5n2pbde?timestamp=636.285266  Um, and then I think the second thing I'm going to touch upon is social, just because that's something that you're exploring.  And then the last thing I can touch upon is like the AI, um, writing stuff, which is not in the product right now, but probably coming in six weeks.  Um, do you want me to skip on SEO completely or is that some?\n",
      "\n",
      "11:01 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think you probably want me to touch upon any capacity. I would say like we are very sophisticated from ASEAN standpoint.  OK, I'm going to just pass on our thing for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "11:16 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, cool. So with Acme, essentially like what we help companies do is like manage the content workflow all the way from ideation to publishing and directly connecting to client websites, whether that be on WordPress or Webflow or HubSpot or the next JS site and distributing that content.  So all content really starts at the idea stage where we help companies collect their ideas in a single place from all over the place.  So if you want to engage with your clients and help them figure out, OK, like this is what we're working on.  If you want to upload some of this stuff, you want to comment on some of this stuff, have discussions on this stuff.  You can do that with them from here. You can also do things like sort of like bulk create these ideas or you can upload them from a spreadsheet and pull them all into a single place over here.  And there are different views to sort of like we'll get your ideas as well. So I can kind of see them in a more tabular view.  We'll automatically pull in search volume, SEO difficulty, all that kind of stuff where available. All the data is taken from SEMrush as well.  We'll pull in the top competing page. The main authority of that page, all that kind of stuff as well as any custom feels you create, you can set those values.  From here I can move things around and prioritize stuff. So that is sort of ideas. From here what I can do with our ideas is I can actually go ahead and I can assign them to writers.  So I can click on assign and I can also bulk assign and this brings up our content calendar. On my content calendar I can go and figure out like when I want something to go out.  And I can just drop it on the calendar and it will pre-populate all of these fields in case. on rules you've set up.  You can set up owners for different stages. You can set up like number of days or between different stages and deadlines.  We'll back calculate all these deadlines from the published date and we'll account for weekends so that you're not assuming like something's going to happen during the weekend as well.  From here, you can either assign it to somebody on your team or if you're working with freelance writers, you just want permission to access your stack.  You can click on this and you can just send them a link or add their email. They'll have permission to access to just write that one piece.  They won't see anything else and they'll actually get a separate workflow as well. What their workflow is going to look like is something more akin to this where they can see something assigned to them and I'm just going to pull something out from here.  They'll have the ability to chat with you. They'll see a checklist of exactly what they need to be doing.  they'll be able to see the company style guide, they'll be able to see their brief with any assignments or data that they have, and then they just essentially have to go through this step by step and make sure that they have everything submitted by these deadlines.  We'll send email notifications automatically when things are due. We'll send reminders when things are overdue to go with you and them.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:26 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:27 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Any questions so far of what I've showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "14:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:32 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Go for it, Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "14:34 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. So you set the date that you want the content to be published in the content calendar. It auto back dates based on whatever steps you've identified.  I've played with this already in your tool. What happens when I have, because we're an agency, I have 10 pieces due to my client on the 15th.  And I want my contractors, I want my team to work. on different pieces on different days. So I don't want them to have to do all of their blueprints on one day that happens to be 10 days before that final drop day.\n",
      "\n",
      "15:10 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Am I able to change? Like it'll auto create. It'll auto populate based on these rules. So if you go into settings and go to blog, you'll go down to content workflow.  You can see that I can set these kind of like number of business days between stages, right? I can also create my different stages in here as well.  So I can say, okay, like this is always going to be the project owner, or this is going to be one of these people or anything along those lines.  And so I can create new stages as well. And so as soon as you click on a sign, what's going to happen is it's going to take these stages, it's going to take these days, and it's going to like backfill everything for you.  Now if you want to change that anyway. Like you still have those drop downs in the fields and you can go in and manually change it up.  And it can also like partially backfill for you as well. So for example, if I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.  If I go ahead and assign something and then I'm just like oops, I want to move the outline review deadline to a different date.  I can I can like click on a different date over here and I'll move my screen over a little bit.  So it's it's complaining because the dates are it's going in the past. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, but you can click on maintain gap between deadlines and then when I switch one of these in between dates, so 23rd to 27th, I think I can probably pick 24th and what it should do at that point is it moves all of the other dates before that as well to maintain that gap between them.  So you can move somebody around where you don't want them all to be like, do the same day before and you can, you can, you can move those around for sure.  And one other question before I stop talking to conversation, does that content calendar only show the final published date of each piece or each step in this process?  It is by default, just showing you the, uh, the final published date. If you go here and click on expand deadlines, um, it'll, let me do that.  And this is not something I've used recently. Okay. What it should be doing, um, is if you click on expand deadlines, it'll show you like all over the in between dates as well.  And let me just check if this is something that is specific to my workspace, which is why I'm not seen it here.  Okay. So that is a bug, but what I will normally see is like all of the deadlines and intermediate states being open.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:01 - Taylor Esposito (5tools)\n",
      "  up as well. Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "18:06 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  And what I can do is once that's fixed, I'll get that fixed, it's Thursday, I'll get that fixed by Monday and I'll send you a viewing video of that if that's interesting as well.  Thank you, that would be lovely. Can I, should I keep going? Okay. So, yep, so we have your contact calendar, you assign everything, people get their notifications.  You also can get notifications in Slack as well, so if you go to settings integrations and you connect Slack, you can get notifications in Slack, whenever some things do, it'll ping you.  And we're e2 all about stuff as well. So it's not just on email. You can track all of your content in our project board over here.  I can just see like what means my attention by this going to mine. We'll just show me the things which I need to take a look at where I can see everything.  I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff. I can see everything. I can filter their stuff.  I can see I wanted to see everything I was assigned to, like, one of our writers or a single person or by approval or due date, all that kind of stuff.  And for each one of these, if I were to click into them, we have like common history and we can discuss the state of this project with Ad mentions, videos, wounds, all that kind of stuff.  I can see the, like, brief keyword data, all the data in terms of who's assigned to what deadlines. And then I can also track the status as it moves through different stages.  So I know if there's any delay or something like that, I can check in and see, like, okay, like, this was moved to the stage this many days ago, or it changed hands this many days ago, all that kind of stuff.  I can track that comes in handy sometimes, especially when you're doing a client, so they're like, what's the status and stuff?  And you can just point to this and say, okay, it's been sitting in your stage for this many days.  We can show it to you here. All this stuff, if a lot of these things move automatically from stage to stage as they're moving through the letter drop process.  So for example, we have a built-in, I guess you call it blueprints or outlines type thing, where you can create these fields.  You can get people to fill these out. You can have comments, all that kind of stuff on it. And you can send these back by either requesting a revision or approving them.  When you do this, they automatically send them emails and move from stage to stage over here. We separate these out so that you actually have an object, which shows you this blueprint before you write the draft.  I know a lot of people today, they'll have a Google Doc that's essentially right over it. And then you tend to not have something to compare it to.  And then finally, we have the actual CMS. You can create templates and store them and use them if you want to.  In the CMS, once again, incredibly collaborative support for comments and all this stuff, including video comments if you just want to talk over stuff instead of having to actually write down stuff blind by blind.  Suggestions mode, bunch of SEO tooling, you're not super interested, very easy to access your style guide, the actual brief, the outline from here as well, revision, history, chat, all that stuff.  And this is directly connected to the CMS. So you're never going to have a situation where what you've presented or given to the client is different from what's probably going out there because it's going from here directly to the CMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "21:47 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's all integrated. So you're seeing a live view of the the, well, the editor like the authoring environment of the CMS right now.  So like as you make changes in your review and submit, it's a. in this instance, Webflow?\n",
      "\n",
      "22:03 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yes, correct. So in our case, our site's on Webflow, it's connected directly to Webflow. We can connect to multiple CMS collections in Webflow.  And so as soon as I go in here, I'm gonna like essentially update this. When I click on update, it's immediately going to go to Webflow.  And so I think at a very high level, that is workflow stuff. I'm happy to go into socials and like assisted writing next, unless you have more questions about workflow.  Oh, I guess one thing which I didn't show you is the sort of agency stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:46 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So you can see I opened up this little dropdown on the top and I can see a bunch of workspaces that I'm currently in.\n",
      "\n",
      "22:52 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right, and so if you go back here and click on my clients, you get you get. I pulled out into this sort of like agency view.  And actually like the only people who can see this are people with the agency permission. So if you go into our rules and permissions, you can see that some people have different permissions from others, viewers, agencies, admins, teammates, et cetera.  So when I go here, I'm kind of stepping back and seeing everything from a 30,000 foot view across workspaces.  I'm seeing like what drafts are due on my side. So as a writer, I'd see this kind of stuff.  And then on the planning side, I can actually see the content calendar across different workspaces here. So I can filter it through and I can see across a lot of different companies which are using this.  Let's see if this works here. That feature is just completely not working today, unfortunately. But essentially I would also be able to see across all of my clients that be able to click in and just see like what's due today.\n",
      "\n",
      "23:59 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  So I'm actually up.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:00 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Uh, I got. Sorry, go ahead. I'm gonna go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "24:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  It's the, um, this is like, it'd be great if you have it. I don't expect you to, but a re like a resource thing side.  So we have, we've gotten the point where we are fairly confident in the number of hours that takes it each stage.  So is there any way to see like this contractor is this many hours assigned to him, this person has this many hours assigned to him.  Is that a capability?\n",
      "\n",
      "24:31 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Again, like I would have. It is. It is. Yeah, it's not a capability. Um, it is not the first time somebody has, um, brought that up though.  Um, we have a client, um, or customer. Um, these guys have like a whole operation and they publish with a hundred articles per month or something along these lines.  And so what they asked me for was like writer analytics, essentially, like how many hours is somebody spending on a piece?  Like what is their? throughput, all that kind of stuff. So it's not the first time that's been asked and it's not something that's completely out of line.  We don't have that capability right now. I wouldn't say it's like not something we would ever add to the roadmap.  I do definitely see that as being something that we could potentially include. It is probably not a priority for the next two months.  But after that, I think when we reevaluate the product roadmap, it's totally for our game.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:31 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  I think that's gonna be one of those things that's on our, that we all consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "25:35 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. And so this view right now, what I'm just seeing is the same thing which I showed you across for the project work for a single company, but I'm just seen in a cross company.  So we can now see the little company logos on top of them, they're all color coded. I can see them across these different workspaces and I can filter across them as well.  I can turn some of them on or off or anything like that. So this is like the sort of overview view I was telling you.  Okay. about it is not very publicly used, however. It's largely internally by us. When we decided that we wanted to really open up like an agency offering, we're going to really polish this up.  But right now it's kind of like, oh, this is kind of like a school internal view that we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:22 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Okay. If this is something that works out with this, be something that you're able to make available to is this, I'm assuming this is what Skyler is using as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, this is what Skyler is using as well. I believe Skyler's situation is he's using Leather Drop for himself right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Or for Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "26:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  That's his first thing. And he has just brought on like another client right now. And I think he is one by one trying to expand all of them to start using the systems that I can start using, like looking at everybody through this kind of view.  But I believe what he's doing right now is just more. So like navigating between these different workspaces on a per client basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:04 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:09 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Um, should I talk about socials next?\n",
      "\n",
      "27:11 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah. Sounds great.\n",
      "\n",
      "27:12 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Cool. So once again, you can connect socials for all of your, uh, customers on a whole bunch of different channels for B2B clients, like LinkedIn is a big one.  You can connect multiple social accounts. Um, it's as simple as honestly just sharing a link and then you can get the entire sales team to, to drop in their socials.  I can show you an example of what that looks like for somebody who has it. So you can see that this company has ever eight people, um, we're all collaborating social wise.  Um, on the social side, you can also once again, plan it on your, on your quantum calendar, you will see all of your social posts in here as well.  You can see some of my LinkedIn posts, um, on different channels, um, here as well. Um, I can either post the socials independently.  So I can just say, Hey, like I want to drop like a LinkedIn post. and then I close to the company account, write something up.  Or when I am publishing a long form piece of content, I can redistribute that automatically to socials as well.  So I can say once this article is published to my webflow site, I wanted to also go out to the company, to the company, LinkedIn account, and as well as my personal account, I can say when I want this to go out, I want this to go out a day later, I want this to go out at a specific time, will automatically generate the final URL along the tracking frame for you as well.  And so you can just like pop those in. The other cool thing we do is like we automate engagement so you can automatically get likes from your teammates.  A lot of the marketing departments today will post in Slack and say, hey, everybody engaged with this, so like your connection, see it.  Very important for sales teams because they are connected with prospects. So them being able to do that is important.  And so. what this does is just kind of like automates that process for you. You can do the same thing with comments as well.  We'll essentially just send people a little slack message saying, okay, somebody wanted a comment from you and they'll take them to this page.  They'll see a little drop comment. They'll see the post and then they'll see suggestions and the CSS is a little bit off here, but they'll see suggestions for like based on this content.  They'll see, okay, I can take this edit this a little bit, make it sound more human and then go ahead and comment on that.  So that's kind of socials for you. It's like, automatic redistribution of blog posts and then like individual redistribution as well.  And you can also do things like sort of like ghost write and like request permissions. So I can write a drop here on LinkedIn.  And then I might be an admin. So I might not be able to do that. But for some of the.  When I write something, it's gonna say get approved and I can say like, hey, I want like whatever I want this person to actually approve this before it goes out.  Any questions about socials? The last thing I wanted to show you, and this is not live yet, is what we're building into our editor.  So a lot of good writing just like really boils down to good frameworks. And so what we're doing is we're building those kinds of frameworks into the CMS itself.  So you can do something like type slash introduction. In the CMS, it's gonna start asking you a bunch of questions like who is the reader?  What kind of framework do you want to use for writing? It's gonna ask you a couple of questions about the problem you're trying to solve, like the pink point you're trying to solve.  And then takes all this information. And essentially boils that into, puts them to like open AI along with some training data we have from like our previous clients and gets you something, gets you an output.  So it's using AI, but it's not outsourcing thinking. The thinking is still done by a person, which is the real thing that needs to be done.  It's just like piecing things together in a way that makes sense. And so this is probably gonna come out in the next, I wanna say like five to six weeks, but this is something that a lot of our customers are excited about, because it just reduces the burden in terms of like trying to figure out like how do we write stuff.  I think people, the real job of like people moving forward, especially in this world, like all this AI writing and all that stuff is gonna be answering the right questions and knowing like what is the angle we wanna take on this?  Like who is this actually for? Can you really empathize with the CEO of Fortune 500 company that your client is.  Thank you. selling to. And because I think like rehab AI content where it's just like taking the top stuff from, from the web and just like putting it together.  I think we're going to build blindness to that where people have like a good intuitive sense for like, okay, like this is just like rehash crap.  Okay, this, this piece of content actually has a perspective, it has an opinion, it has quotes from like an industry leader.  This is the thing that's going to inform my decision making for something. And so we're trying to like help like massage AI tools to do more of that and less of whatever they're doing right now where you can go in and chat.  You can't say writing an article on XYZ and it'll give you a lot of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "32:44 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I think how a lot of people are using them right now is like just one step reduced of just like using this paraphrasing tools that have been out forever.  It's like, are you done? It's just have a bot that didn't tell you. was paraphrasing like stuff that existed online.  And I just had a chat with a publisher or a billy named Technically and we just chat back and forth and he was like, this thing's the end of creativity.  And I'm like, it's not the end of creativity. It's just, it's a bunch of VA's, right? Like it's just gonna automatically those like menial tasks and there's still like a level of creativity and new insight.  Like you can't, you just can't create new insights from AI right now for the most part because it's using existing knowledge as its basis, right?  It's not critically thinking the same way I human this.\n",
      "\n",
      "33:41 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. I think the interesting stuff is when you get it to like, what happens when we start connecting this with data sources really?  So you can actually get it to actually like pull those insights from somewhere else. And then you have a person actually like sort of like direct it and say like, hey, like these are the insights you wanna pull.  Like getting a statistic on something and put that in here. And then gives you a bunch of statistics. You still have to go to fact check them because it's just generating a stat and it's like likely to be true, but not really.  But I think that's the kind of stuff where you're like, hey, here's how we actually tell a story. Here's how we get people to care.  At least right now, whenever I see AI content, it's so easy to see that something is nothing like, essentially like I don't really care if it was written by AI or human or purple alien.  I care about whether it's useful to me. Ultimately, everyone's selfish and they care about whether it's useful. And I think the way people are using it right now or how I see a content is it's not useful for the most part.  The same as like content, no content. I'm also like, yeah, this is just the same thing, but instead of people doing it, it's just like an AI doing it for a couple of cents instead of a person doing it for like 20 bucks.  It's equally not helpful. So yeah. Yeah, I think definitely not the depth of creativity. It's just the depth of a lot of stuff people have been doing in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:09 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, it's like the cheapest worst on Fiverr is kind of like what I see. It's like, okay, yeah, we're asking them to write you an ebook, like you've gone to the wrong place.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:21 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "35:24 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  The questions I ever really hit around the agency side, which would be like, how are you pricing the agency side of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "35:33 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah, so that is not something we have really figured out to give you context. Like for everything you saw, the project management stuff, like all that is $800 a month.  What we really expected in one, I think, is going to do is essentially like off of that cost to his customer.  Once again, I think he's also operating at the range. You guys are doing 10,000,000, 20,000,000, something along those lines.  And like, yeah, I can eat the costs or off-way to the customer. For other agencies, what we've talked about is, I'm happy to give away 20% the subscription cost in some format.  How an agency wants to use that is up to them, whether they want to take a 20% for themselves as like, I'm essentially putting this into another company for you and still it's like a rev share kind of thing.  That's one option. The other is what the revenue is a drop in the bucket for me when we're charging 10, 20K per month.  What's more important is like me making an easy sell to this customer so that we can actually get the infrastructure when even place to succeed with them.  Can I use this as an exclusive discount? This is like an exclusive five tool discount too. And in the same way you'd say like, hey, I really need us to use any of you to buy a Sam Rush license for us to do this for you.  We work with Sam Rush and we have an exclusive 20% off discount for you since you're working with us.  SEMrush can you go buy SEMrush? And so that's the other way in which I position to people. So how do you wanna use that 20% is completely up to you?  Can go to you, can go to the customer, that's totally okay. And so that's what we've been doing, but also in full transparency, this is only been something I've been thinking about since like late December.  And Skyler is one of three agencies who has organically adopted letter drop. Like we haven't, like we're not pushing to go in and sell into agencies right now.  They just found it, they really liked it. And they were like, yeah, we wanna get on this thing. So that's the current state of affairs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "37:38 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Yeah, I mean, we had a agency quotas building a custom solution and I was like, you're crazy. It's one 20th of this thing and it was like, well in excess of 50, 60, 70,000.  And it closed to what we needed. And so we've been working on internal stuff. We've been leveraging workflows within a size.  I don't know, like we've gotten pretty deep in like leveraging existing technology to do some of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:05 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:06 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  This is a lot of appeal. I think we just need to look at the economics and honestly, we're going to float it by a few clients that this would be a great fit for and just be like, Hey, if we were to provide this, uh, let's just say, 800 minus 20% whatever that is, we probably go to that exclusive.  This is bringing up. You'll be like, Hey, if we were to like do this and build it through, like, it makes our life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:29 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  It makes your life easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "38:32 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  Um, would you be interested in it? And I think that's the best way for us to go about it and get one or two clients on it initially, see how it works for us and then kind of work from there.\n",

      "\n",
      "38:43 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Right. If you want to like a really easy way to like make a dollar value argument and people, um, and this only works for you mentioned CRC plus company.  So this is probably true of them. If they have a large sales force or customer facing, um, sales force, the other calculator on our site, you can essentially plug in the number of  whatever SDRs or AEs are customer-facing folks in their teams, when let's say 30 people, you can say like, hey, here's how much like content we're producing for you on LinkedIn across various accounts.  Again, we're experts for social for LinkedIn. And then this calculator essentially figures out like roughly a number of impressions that's equivalent to.  And if they were spending on LinkedIn ads, this is essentially the cost of that in LinkedIn ad spend. So as soon as the company is of any sort of meaningful size, suddenly that number doesn't seem so bad.  Because this is literally just money you're leaving on the table by not getting your team to distribute content for you if you're also spending on LinkedIn ads.  So that's a really good argument I found in terms of just dollar value, saying like, hey, this tool kind of pays for itself.  And this is independent of the content creation. All the other stuff I showed you, this is just purely that one feature on a LinkedIn distribution side of names.  Now, if they don't have a big sales team or they're not spending on LinkedIn ads, they're like, yeah, like none of our customers are on LinkedIn.  Like this obviously, Matt doesn't check out or make sense, but for this target audience, a lot of them are on LinkedIn and so it works.\n",

      "  Thank you. Sorry, Madam was barking. I think this is great. I think we, Taylor, you've got a few days, nine or so days left.  I think one of the things we were gonna test out is we've got like a must of sandbox site.  I use keyword research. I think Taylor invited me, but I was, we don't have any client to like plug into this yet.  But what I was hoping is like, I can create my demo account or whatever. And as soon as we've done our keyword research, and then we're gonna like test the workflow into like assigning it to our writers, getting pieces written, pushing it directly into our sandbox site, which is.  It's like, right? So it's a WordPress site and pushing it in and running through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "41:04 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  So if I go sign up, will like a demo free access account for like 14 days? Yeah. You don't have to sign up.  Um, um, Taylor just makes invite you. So Taylor, if you go to, um, settings admin and just invite, um, Mark, um, and Sean over, you can, you can go ahead and do that and, um, they'll get an invitation.  Um, and then they can just, we can all work out of the same workspace. Um, uh, note on WordPress.  It does require a little bit of stuff from my end. I'll send you a tutorial on like how to set up WordPress.  Um, and then you essentially have to send me back a key, which I'm going to plug into our backend.\n",
      "\n",
      "41:39 - Marc Freund (5tools)\n",
      "  And then once I do that, you should be able to, uh, directly connect to WordPress. Okay. We'll be ready with a keyword research for like another.  Probably a week. Uh, and yours runs out in what like seven or eight days Taylor?\n",
      "\n",
      "41:53 - Homer (Acme)\n",
      "  Yeah. Taylor, Taylor, if you want to extend that, that's completely fine by me. Um, just let me know like when, how long we need for tests.  Seeing I'll just go in. What's your, what's just tell me your email address that you sign up with. I'll go find the workspace and I'll kind of just like make sure that that doesn't expire for you.\n",

So in terms of next steps, it sounds like you want some time to play with it and like really understand how it works.  If there's any questions, any bugs, Taylor, like that bugs with the collapsed deadlines, expanded lines, we're very responsive. And we can be because you get to talk directly to CEO, become like, I care very deeply about our customers.  It's not like a sauna. We're like, I'm going to file a bug report and they'll look at this in eight months.  We'll feel like we're constantly adding new features, which also means we break things occasionally and we'll go fix them again.  So let me know very communicative about that kind of stuff. I'll send your. trial by another week or so, and I'll send you a recording of this call so you can go back and view anything if you need it, and I'll send you that link to a calculator, and then what would make sense in terms of next steps, in terms of like connecting again and discussing what you'd like to do?\n",

Oh good Well, we did a ton of content for them Amazing I learned sales from you guys actually They're they're really good Ryan Robinson works for him He actually has his own blog as like over a half million views on Ryan is the person Ryan is the person I reached out to I think Yeah, I'll talk with Ryan and let him know they've got they've got a machine over there I certainly would love if they're using it As we continue to work with them But they'd be a good Whether it's using it through us or they're just using themselves like we like Ryan and their team a lot so no matter what Yeah, it's incredibly valuable for them Absolutely and yeah, hopefully this works out for you and in two weeks We get to work together, but I also want to let you know in the same way that and I offer this to Skyler as well is While we are not\n",

And so learning more about your needs, kind of like the writer analytics and like work, like putting like the number of hours in there.  Like the more you can share in terms of what you need there, that's thing, those are things we can think about and figure out like how they fit into workflow and we can actually solve those problems for you as well.  So yeah, like very open to like listening and like working together in the future, regardless of whether or not you actually want to use a solution right now or if it's a fit for now, I'm sure we can find other ways to work together and maybe touch a touch base again in the future.\n",

I'm like, what are processes for pain points that are like, I'm happy to just do like an hour call with you and just say like ask away, like do fact finding, happy to share whatever like, wear an open book, we're trying to figure all this stuff out.  Yeah, we know the pain pretty. Ultimately, for our agency, and it is just a data point. So I've worked with a startup that made NEGS that did really, they did well, they sold off all that.  But one of the things I thought was really valuable in that process was like just being able to sit down and talk to people who are doing this every single day.  And I thought that was like the best way to figure out developing out the product. And I know that you can't do everything for everyone.  Like we had customers that had their like, but I need to do this. And I'm like, you're one of like you are the only one that does it this way.  And like I forget like you're not gonna solve all of our problems, but if you know, enough people have it then it's gonna get sold.\n",
